# website-project-sean

For this project, I used a total of 3 bootstrap templates - the blog home page (https://startbootstrap.com/template/blog-home), the about page (), and the contact page (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/). Each comes with primary stylesheets (style.css, cover.css, and carousel.css) that were included in the original zips (along with .js scripts). I then created my own stylesheet for index.html (indexattr.css) to make my own edits to the starter template. The main styleshet is based on _root.scss from Bootsrap 5.0, which thus has a comprehensive list classes and their respective elements.

The main logo/icon and inlcuded images are either .png or .jpg stored in images_webisteproject folder or copied URLs from google. Each image is a hyperlink to a relevant article or social media page. To include the global running icon in the title bar, I imported the facvicon.ico library.
